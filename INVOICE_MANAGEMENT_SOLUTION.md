## New Backend API Endpoints

### Invoice Management
```http
DELETE /api/invoices/{invoice_id}
DELETE /api/invoices
PUT /api/invoices/{invoice_id}
```

### Features Added
1. **Authentication Required**: All delete/update operations require user authentication
2. **Soft Delete Option**: Can be easily modified to implement soft deletes instead
3. **Audit Trail Ready**: Structure supports adding audit logging
4. **Error Responses**: Proper HTTP status codes and error messages

## Frontend Enhancements

### Enhanced Invoice Management Page
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Action Buttons**: View, Download, Delete for each invoice
- **Status Management**: Quick status updates via dropdown
- **Bulk Operations**: Delete all invoices functionality
- **Advanced Filtering**: Search, status filter, date range filter
- **Professional PDF Generation**: High-quality invoice PDFs with proper formatting

### User Experience Improvements
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: Prevent accidental deletions
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during operations
- **Success/Error Messages**: Clear user feedback
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Efficient navigation and actions
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML

## Technical Implementation Details

### Backend (`server.py`)
```python
@api_router.delete("/invoices/{invoice_id}")
async def delete_invoice(invoice_id: str, current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)):
    """Delete a specific invoice"""
    result = await db.invoices.delete_one({"id": invoice_id})
    if result.deleted_count == 0:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Invoice not found")
    return {"message": "Invoice deleted successfully"}

@api_router.delete("/invoices")
async def delete_all_invoices(current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)):
    """Delete all invoices (bulk delete)"""
    result = await db.invoices.delete_many({})
    return {
        "message": f"All invoices deleted successfully",
        "deleted_count": result.deleted_count
    }
```

### Frontend (`EnhancedInvoicesPage.js`)
- **State Management**: React hooks for managing invoices, filters, and UI state
- **API Integration**: Axios for HTTP requests with error handling
- **PDF Generation**: html2canvas + jsPDF for client-side PDF creation
- **Real-time Updates**: Immediate UI updates after operations

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**: All invoice operations require valid JWT token
2. **Authorization**: Users can only access their own data
3. **Input Validation**: Proper validation on all user inputs
4. **SQL Injection Prevention**: Using MongoDB with proper query methods
5. **XSS Prevention**: All user data is properly escaped

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Lazy Loading**: Invoice data loaded on demand
2. **Efficient Filtering**: Client-side filtering for better responsiveness
3. **Optimized Queries**: Minimal database queries with proper indexing
4. **Caching Strategy**: Local state caching reduces API calls

## Usage Instructions

### For Users:
1. **Navigate to Manage Section**: Click "Manage" in the navigation
2. **View Invoices**: See all invoices in a comprehensive table
3. **Filter & Search**: Use the search bar and filters to find specific invoices
4. **Individual Actions**:
   - Click üëÅÔ∏è to view invoice details
   - Click üìÑ to download PDF
   - Click üóëÔ∏è to delete individual invoice
   - Use dropdown to change status
5. **Bulk Operations**: Use "Delete All Invoices" button to clear all data

### For Developers:
1. **Backend Setup**: Ensure MongoDB is running and configured
2. **Environment Variables**: Set up proper JWT secret and database URLs
3. **Dependencies**: Install all required Python packages
4. **Frontend Setup**: Run `npm install` and start the React development server

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Create multiple invoices with different statuses
- [ ] Test individual invoice deletion
- [ ] Test bulk invoice deletion
- [ ] Test PDF download functionality
- [ ] Test status updates
